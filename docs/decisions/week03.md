# Decision Week 3: Shifting the structure to client side 

**Date:** 2026-09-01  

In week 3 the goal is to change the structure of the program. After much consideration its decided that the "system" works easier if the client does not have to 
connect to the server. Scenerios that include offline work, server down or when the workflow including connecting to the server can cause errors will be eliminated.
The database stays on the server side. Client downloades the duckdb file, pastes it in the project and works with a notebook.
Notebook -> Python Mask -> DB
